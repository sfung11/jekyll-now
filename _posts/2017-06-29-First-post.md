title: Jumping into the data science world
---

I am a trained neuroscientist and until two months ago, I was in academia doing experiments at the bench and publishing on microglia (the brain's immune cells) and their role in brain tumors or Alzheimer's disease. I enjoyed the research, but wanted to spend more time working with data and in scenarios that have more real-life applications.

On many occasions, data science was mentioned as a career path! I did my research on data science training options in Seattle and I am very happy, nervous, excited to be starting this important career transition here at Metis. 

I am just at the beginning of this accelerated training program and look forward (perhaps cringe a little?) at the progression of the posts that I publish here.

Until then, I leave you with this:
